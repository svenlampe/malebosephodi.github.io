I left my academic career to heed the call for more creative expression in my life. the call is to tell stories to heal, to re-imagine and to re-member. my work is rooted in African Eco-Feminism and i use personal narrative to explain the world. here, you will find my interdisciplinary journey in writing, photography, speaking and organising. may you see yourself reflected in this creative expression 

(very rough still needs work)
