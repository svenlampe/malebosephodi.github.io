many of you may have found me through my award-winning book, Miss Behave, or from one of my speaking or media engagements, through academia, in a healing circle, or perhaps one of my photographs moved you. over the past two decades, i’ve built a diverse life’s work that spans community, creativity, the corporate world and academia. storytelling has always been the thread, woven through everything i’ve found myself called to. 
as a little girl, i would imagine worlds far and beyond my existence. as a grown woman, nothing much has changed, except the stakes. i no longer tell stories just to slip into other worlds but to dismantle the ones that cage us. i tell stories through words, images and embodiment. at the heart of my work is the pursuit of freedom through the alchemy of memory, self-witnessing and personal narrative, guided by the wisdom of Nature.
my work now centres on tending to the generational wounds and trauma we carry individually and collectively, holding them gently in nurturing spaces of restoration. the call is in the collective. together, we create and fortify new ways of being rooted in radical love and joy.
