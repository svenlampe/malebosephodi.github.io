[malebo sephodi on stage](/assets/images/malebo/01_malebo_speaking.jpg)

i was born on stage. i don’t remember a time when i wasn’t holding a mic.

i bring a unique presence to conversations – whether it’s a keynote, workshop, panel discussion, facilitated dialogue or lecture. i;m not a conventional speaker. i don’t perform speeches; i create conversations. i don’t get caught up in the rules of public speaking. my approach is rooted in ancient storytelling, where voices flowed freely.  
this is sacred, fluid and deeply personal. it matters to me that every person in the audience feels seen, heard and understood, no matter the topic i am holding. 
i hold space for deep introspection, meaningful connection and transformation that leads to action.
