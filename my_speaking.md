i was born on stage. i do not remember when i was not on a stage with a mic in hand. i bring a uniqueness to conversations, keynotes, workshops, panel discussions, facilitated dialogues and lectures/teaching. i am not a conventional speaker. i don’t perform speeches, i create conversations. my approach is sacred, fluid and deeply personal. it’s important that the audience feels seen, heard and understood no matter the topic i am tackling.i hold space for deep introspection, connection and transformation/action
