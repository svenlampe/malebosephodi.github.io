before i ever called myself a photographer, i was already using visual art in my community work. i didn’t believe i had what it took but i often worked alongside great photographers, guiding the creative direction behind the scenes.  
Then in 2018, i felt an urgent calling to use visual art as a channel. as my relationship with nature and the land deepened, i began to find ways to whisper echoes through writing and photography.
