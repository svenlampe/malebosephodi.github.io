my name is malebo sephodi, i am a storyteller pursuing freedom through the alchemy of memory, self-witnessing and personal narrative. after leaving my academic career, i fully embrace my creative expression, allowing deep reflection to guide my journey forward.

to honour this moment, i am working on an unfolding series, Seasons of Becoming, a self-portrait project chronicling my vulnerable journey of RE-MEMBERING as ART. a return to creativity in alignment with my truth.

through this, i explore the intersections of identity, healing and radical joy as sites of liberation.

this series is deeply rooted in nature's wisdom. the embodied knowledge essential to Becoming.

through this series, i invite others to reflect on their own Becoming and the possibilities of freedom through communal belonging.

by reclaiming our voices and honouring our stories, we create spaces that disrupt colonial narratives and affirm the lived experiences of African Women and Femmes.

let's journey together.
