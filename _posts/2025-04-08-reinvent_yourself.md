title: reinvent yourself until you find home

perhaps this should have been my first post, but here we go…

on 18 February 2023, i shared my decision to leave the academy to pursue my creative expression. it has been a tumultuous journey, one not short of darkness, but i did it. it feels like a full-circle moment because, circa 2011, i walked away from a high-paying corporate job to pursue my heart’s work, Soul Ova. but somewhere in between i got swept up in academia, lost myself in it, and almost forgot my heart. and here’s the thing: i didn’t need to endure all of that to know what i now know. i was always going to know it. yet, the academy gave me something. it shaped me, stretched me and offered a sense of appreciation for nuance. i carry that with me now. i’m now in the light, i create in light. and the light has led me home.

home is in my creation. it is in the one i physically gave birth to. it is in my art, my heart, my breath, my community.

i have spent many lifetimes reinventing myself to arrive here. i’m not here to give you saccharine motivation or hollow self-help. what i offer is myself, the raw, sacred parts of my being, the things that move through me, the light and shadows alike. so, let me reintroduce myself… my Seasons Of Becoming
