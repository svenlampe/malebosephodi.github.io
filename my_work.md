## Writing

i write to make sense of the world and reimagine new possibilities. as xxx says “a new world is possible.” my words are shaped by African Eco-feminism using personal narrative in pursuit of freedom. accessible writing is close to me. xxxxxxxxxxxxx

## Photography 

before i called myself a photographer i used visual art in my soul ova work. as my relationship grew closer with the land and nature, i found ways to whisper its echoes through photography. the work is rooted in environmental justice xxxxx. i am also interested in the femmes relationship to nature.
