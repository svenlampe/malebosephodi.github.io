before publishing Miss Behave, i had pen friends. growing up, i kept a diary, and later, i journaled ritually. i wrote long, elaborate statuses on social media and ran about three blogs. one for fiction, another on identity politics and centered on the local scene. that was some of my best writing - free, unbound by ideas of what “good writing” should be. as Miriam Tlali once said, we do not write for recognition but for the people. i wanted to make knowledge accessible.

when i wrote Miss Behave, i wanted to experiment. i was interested in deconstructing literary elitism. after the book, there was pressure to release the next one but i was guided by Sade Adu’s words when she said: “i only make music when i feel i have something to say, i am not interested in releasing music just for the sake of selling something. Sade is not a brand.” i return to this quote whenever i feel pressured to release something before its time.

it took me a while to understand and accept that i am a Spirit writer. i only write when there is something that must be said through me. for me to write, i need to align with my collaborator, Nature. when i fall out of alignment, inspiration ceases.
